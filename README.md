Transport times - Alexa skill

This Alexa skills aims to make train and bus times accessible using voice input and provide audible responses for the 
requested transport services. Since it would be too complicated to replicate the skill on a local machine, the skill 
can be tested using the Beta Program. Along with the testing of the beta version of the app, The basic features of the
application can be also be viewed using a CLI application. This is a simple application that will return the real time
